# Implementation Plan for Multi-Agent AI Collaboration Tool

This document outlines the steps needed to complete the implementation of the multi-agent AI collaboration tool, focusing on addressing all placeholders and TODOs.

## High Priority Items

### 1. Update Model Configurations
- [ ] Update DeepSeek R1 model configuration with correct name and parameters
- [ ] Replace placeholder for OpenAI O3 Mini High (currently "gpt-3.5-turbo")
- [ ] Replace placeholder for OpenAI O1 (currently "gpt-4o")
- [ ] Replace placeholder for Claude 3.7 Thinking (currently "claude-3-7-sonnet-20240229")
- [ ] Replace placeholder for Claude 3.6 (currently "claude-3-opus-20240229")

### 2. API Integration
- [ ] Confirm and test DeepSeek API integration with CrewAI
- [ ] Confirm and test Anthropic API integration with CrewAI
- [ ] Confirm and test OpenAI API integration with newer models
- [ ] Add proper error handling for API rate limits and other common errors

## Medium Priority Items

### 3. Improve Parsing and Error Handling
- [ ] Enhance JSON parsing in `parse_evaluation_result()` function in utils.py
- [ ] Enhance JSON parsing in `parse_improvement_result()` function in utils.py
- [ ] Implement more robust error handling for malformed responses
- [ ] Add retry logic for API calls

### 4. Optimize Asynchronous Processing
- [ ] Review and optimize asynchronous execution in CrewAI
- [ ] Implement better parallelization for API calls
- [ ] Add timeouts and circuit breakers for long-running operations

## Low Priority Items

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Add more comprehensive logging
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Improve docstrings and comments
- [ ] Create a more detailed user guide

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated queries
- [ ] Optimize token usage to reduce API costs
- [ ] Add support for local models as fallback options

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

Before implementing these changes, we need to:

1. Obtain API keys for all services (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek)
2. Get accurate model names and optimal parameters for each service
3. Confirm compatibility with the latest version of CrewAI
4. Test each API integration individually before combining them

## Testing Plan

For each implementation item:

1. Test each model integration individually with simple queries
2. Test the evaluation functionality with controlled inputs
3. Test the improvement functionality with predefined evaluations
4. Test the complete workflow with a variety of question types
5. Monitor token usage and costs during testing

## Estimated Timeline

- High Priority Items: 1-2 days
- Medium Priority Items: 2-3 days
- Low Priority Items: 1-2 days
- Full Testing and Refinement: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 5-9 days depending on complexity of issues encountered
