# Multi-Agent AI Collaboration Tool

This project implements a collaborative AI system using CrewAI to orchestrate multiple state-of-the-art language models. The system enables models to independently answer questions, anonymously evaluate each other's responses, and iteratively improve answers based on structured feedback.

## Features

- Orchestrates multiple AI models (DeepSeek R1, OpenAI O3 Mini High, OpenAI O1, Claude 3.7 Thinking, and Claude 3.6)
- Interactive model selection via checklist interface
- Anonymous evaluation of responses
- Weighted scoring system based on custom criteria
- Iterative improvement of the best answers
- Final judgment round to select the optimal response

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- API keys for various AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the package: `pip install -e .`
3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (see `src/multiagent/config/.env.example`)

## Usage

```bash
# Run as a module with interactive model selection
python -m multiagent "Your question here"

# Use all models without the selection prompt
python -m multiagent --all-models "Your question here"

# Or use the installed command
multiagent "Your question here"
```

## Model Selection

By default, the tool will present a checklist interface allowing you to select which AI models to use for answering your question. You can navigate the checklist using arrow keys and select/deselect models with the spacebar. Press Enter to confirm your selection.

If you prefer to use all available models without the selection prompt, use the `--all-models` flag.
